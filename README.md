# Multimodal Movie Genre Classification
This is Fabio Ferreira Freitas's project for the final exam in the Machine Learning 2 module.

# Introduction
This project compares three models to classify movies into genres:
  - A pre-trained BERT text classification model using movie plots.
  - A pre-trained VGG image classification model using movie posters.
  - A combined and fine-tuned model integrating both approaches.

The goal is to determine which model performs best.

# Guide
The project is implemented in a Google Colab notebook, utilizing a Colab Pro GPU for data scraping and training the models! Reviewing the notebook step-by-step is recommended to understand the project's workflow. Every step is described and you can see the output already done by every cell. So you don't need to necessarily run the project (scrape data, build and train the models) yourself, to review it. Every data output file is saved in this github repository and explained in the notebook where and when it was generated. Running the project in your own colab session is possible, but success and low computing times are not guaranteed if you do not have google colab pro. 

Reviewing the code and explanation text step-by-step is the best way to gain a comprehensive understanding and review this project!!

# Python version
The Python version used for this project in colab was 3.10.12. The best method is to simply open this project in google colab but if you clone it in Visual Studio Code, make sure you take into account the setup of the correct python version.

# Important Note
If you do wish to run the code yourself read through each step in the notebook carefully!
One step in the notebook requires downloading movie posters and storing them in a session folder. This step is crucial for training the VGG and combined models. To run this code, you'll need an API key for TMDB, which I will provide.
If the runtime is too long, I will also provide a OneDrive folder link containing the downloaded image folder "movie_posters". Over 4000 images were downloaded from TMDB.

Additionally, the OneDrive folder contains the three models generated by this project. The project's goals, description, and results are detailed in the notebook.
