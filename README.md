# Multimodal Movie Genre Classification
This is Fabio Ferreira Freitas's project for the final exam in the Machine Learning 2 module.

# Introduction
This project compares three models to classify movies into genres:
  - A pre-trained BERT text classification model using movie plots.
  - A pre-trained VGG image classification model using movie posters.
  - A combined and fine-tuned model integrating both approaches.

The goal is to determine which model performs best.

# Guide
The project is implemented in a Google Colab notebook, utilizing a Colab Pro GPU for data scraping and model training. Reviewing the notebook step-by-step is recommended to understand the project's workflow. To save computing time on the reviewer's PC, all generated data files are stored in the /data folder in this GitHub repo. The program uses these files where data input is needed, so the reviewer doesn't have to wait for each cell to run.

# Important Note
One step in the notebook requires downloading movie posters and storing them in a session folder. This step is crucial for training the VGG and combined models. To run this code, you'll need an API key for TMDB, which I will provide.

If the runtime is too long, I will also provide a OneDrive folder link containing the downloaded images. Over 4000 images were downloaded from TMDB.

Additionally, the OneDrive folder contains the three models generated by this project. The project's goals, description, and results are detailed in the notebook. Reviewing the code step-by-step will provide a comprehensive understanding.
